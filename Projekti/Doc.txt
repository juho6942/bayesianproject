Notes
- Units and measurement scales are taken directly from the provided source; some unit labels (e.g., LYMR “% (mg/dl)”, MCV “pg”, MCH “fl”) may reflect source formatting and could require verification against your raw lab system. [1]
- “Ratio” fields represent percentages of total white blood cells for the given lineage. [1]
- BloodCulture is a categorical test result (no/yes) rather than a numeric measure. [1]


multicollinearity:

BASOR EOSR MONOR NEUR LYMR : Basofil ratio, Eosinofil ratio, Monocyte ratio, Neutrophil ratio -Nojoo näähän muodostaa osituksen valkosoluille right?
MONO LYM NEU WBC: Corresponding absolute amounts and white bloodcell count
MCV MCHC MCH RBC HCT HGB:  Mean corpuscular volume, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin, Red Bloodcell count, Hemocrit(RBC%/blood), Hemoglobin G/L, 
AMY: Amylase, no idea why it is correlated

Eli valkosolu-featureita sekä punasolu-featureita pitää vähän 

punasolut näyttää ok jos jättää pois:
MCH HCT HGB
Valkosolut jos jättää: 
NEU LYMR
